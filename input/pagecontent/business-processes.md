This page describes the business processes included in the WHO Digital
Adaptation Kit (DAK) on self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) in pregnancy (https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/381616). 
For full details, see the published DAK content.

A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks 
performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, 
such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual 
representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) 
that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” 
for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication 
and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

The DAK for self-monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy focuses on key business processes related to identification and preparation for SMBP, conducting SMBP, and ANC contact.

### Overview of Key Business Processes
