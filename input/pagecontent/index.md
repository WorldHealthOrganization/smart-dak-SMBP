### Summary 
This WHO digital adaptation kit focuses on self-monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy and aims to provide a common language across various audiences – health programme managers, software developers,
and implementers of digital systems – to ensure a common understanding of the appropriate health information content requirements within a defined health
programme area, as a mechanism to catalyse the effective use of these digital systems. 

This DAK also complements the health worker-facing Digital adaptation
kit for antenatal care: operational requirements for implementing WHO recommendations in digital systems [(ANC DAK)](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/339745), in which self-care interventions such as
SMBP may be integrated.<mark>

### L1 Narrative guidelines
WHO recommends self-care interventions within a safe, supportive and enabling environment with appropriate links to the health system. This first
edition of the DAK on self-care interventions focuses on self-monitoring blood pressure in pregnancy in which WHO suggests making the self-monitoring
of blood pressure during pregnancy available as an additional option to clinic blood pressure monitoring by health workers during antenatal
contacts, among individuals with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
