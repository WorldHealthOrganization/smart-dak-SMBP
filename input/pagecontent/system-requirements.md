### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have in order to meet the end-users’ needs and achieve tasks within the business process.

The functional requirements are listed in the high-level functional and non-functional requirements implementation tool of the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) in pregnancy, available [here](system-requirements.html).

Please note that these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements provide the general attributes and features of the digital system to ensure usability and overcome technical and physical constraints. Examples of non-functional requirements include providing password-protected access for authorized users, logging all data and system errors, and provide the ability to easily back up information.
